* Only a logged-in user admin is be able to enter and edit menu items. 
* Menu items have a name, a description, a category (such as appetizer, main course, side, dessert), and a price. 
* Users are able to view the menu, with items grouped by category, and see the names, descriptions, and prices.
* When the user sees their total order, they can add an optional tip of 10%, 15%, or 20%, and resubmit the order to see the total with tip.
